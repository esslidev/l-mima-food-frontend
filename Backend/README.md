# L'mima Food Backend

Welcome to L'mima Food Backend repository! This backend system, built with Node.js, Express.js, and Prisma, features a robust authentication system to secure your applications.

## Features

- **Authentication System**: Secure user authentication with JSON Web Tokens (JWT).
- **Prisma Integration**: Utilizes Prisma for ORM and database operations.
- **RESTful API**: Implements a RESTful API architecture for easy integration with frontend applications.
- **Scalable Architecture**: Built with scalability and maintainability in mind using Node.js and Express.js best practices.

## Technologies Used

- Node.js
- Express.js
- Prisma
- JSON Web Tokens (JWT)
- Docker (optional, for local development)

## Getting Started

These instructions will get you a copy of the project up and running on your local machine for development and testing purposes.

### Prerequisites

- Node.js installed locally
- Docker (if applicable for database setup)

### Installation

1. Clone the repository.

2. Install dependencies using yarn:

    ```bash
    yarn install

3. Set up your environment variables. Create a .env file in the root directory with the following variables:

    ```bash
    JWT_SECRET_ACCESS =00000000-0000-0000-0000-00000000000
    JWT_SECRET_RENEW =00000000-0000-0000-0000-00000000000
    API_SECRET_KEY =00000000-0000-0000-0000-00000000000

    ACCESS_TOKEN_LIFESPAN=1800  
    RENEW_TOKEN_LIFESPAN=86400  
    DB_SOURCE=mysql
    DB_USERNAME=root
    DB_PASSWORD=root
    DB_HOST=host-name
    DB_PORT=3306
    DB_NAME=db-name

    DATABASE_URL=${DB_SOURCE}://${DB_USERNAME}:${DB_PASSWORD}@${DB_HOST}:${DB_PORT}/${DB_NAME}

4. Run database migrations with Prisma:

    ```bash
    yarn run migrate

5. Start the server:

    ```bash
    yarn start
